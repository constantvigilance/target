# Target
goal to be achieved in coming months

1. Till 31st march complete all ongoing coursera courses
   - post your assignments on github
   - convolutional neural networks
   - improving deep neural network
   - convolutional neural network in tensorflow
   - machine learning
   - cs50
   - try to complete one week everyday of each course
   If you do this by the time u join college you will have 5 COURSES in your cv and linkeldn account with professional      certificates.That will certainly increase the weight of your resume.
2. Restart competitive coding
   - solve at least one question on dsa in c++ on codechef dsa course
3. Try to achieve 1550 ranking on codechef
4. Post daily update of completed work in the same file

18-03-19
1. week 1 of convolutional neural networks
2. week 2 (half) of convolutional neural networks
3. 1 question of competitive coding
4. cv updated

Next Day Goal:
1. week 2 and week 3 of convolutional neural network complete
2. 2 competitive coding question of previous contests
3. 1 mail send

19-03-20
1. week 2 completed
2. week 3 done half

Next day goal:
1.week 3 and week 4 of convolutional neural networks
2.mail write
